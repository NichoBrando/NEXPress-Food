# frontend

![buying](https://github.com/NichoBrando/Presentation/blob/master/buying.png)

this frontend has been made with npx create-next-app command.
NextJS is a framework for server side rendering, with ReactJS. I choose to use NextJS, because the foods items, that need to be indexed.

If you start the project, the first page that will appear for you, is this:
![index](https://github.com/NichoBrando/Presentation/blob/master/indexPage.png)

To go to buying foods, you will need to click on `Start Buys`

# Things to update or create
I will work more in this project, to add some functions to it, like:
* Filtered cart
* Payment method with GoGerency (My fictional bank, that i'm currently building)
* Add more photos.
